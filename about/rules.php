<h2>The Rules</h2>
<hr>
<p class="contentBig">
    <ol style="font-size:17px">
        <li>BM, such as Mastery Emotes, or offensive remarks in all chat are NOT allowed.</li>
        <li>Teams must make roster changes at least 2 days before their game. If not, all last minutes changes will result in penalties as follows:</li>
        <li>A team will lose one ban for each sub (not on the roster) used. A team cannot lose anything beyond the max of 3 bans. Teams may change their roster in between games, with due consequences if subs are used.</li>
        <li>The schedule is finalized on Wednesday at 10:00pm EST. If your team has a scheduling conflict, it is your responsibility to tell management before that time so a scheduling change can be made.</li>
        <li>A team that joins the league late will immediately earn one point for every week that they missed.</li>
        <li>Games cannot be restarted once any team gains vision of any enemies. It is the team's responsibility to check runes and masteries before this happens.</li>
        <li>Games may not be paused unless a player is forced to AFK due to an issue in real life (such as a safety issue, etc.), if a player disconnects, or if their equipment is not working properly.</li>
        <li>A forfeit will happen if and only if a) the team captain announces a forfeit or b) the team's entire roster is not in the lobby 15 minutes after the game was scheduled to start (exception if the player is on his way, e.g. logging into client).</li>
        <li>Before games begin, at least one streamer must be in the lobby and confirm that the game is being streamed. If this does not occur, and the game starts anyway, the game will be restarted. NO exceptions. It is both teams' responsibility to make sure that the game is being streamed.</li>
        <li>Cheating, hate/homophobic slurs, or DDoSing will result in the suspect receiving an immediate, permanent ban from the league. Cheating and DDoSing will result in the opposing team receiving credit for a victory.</li>
        <li>Treat everyone in the league with respect, including all management staff and opponents.</li>
        <li>A players main rank can not be Diamond.</li>
        <li>A teams average rank must be between Silver 3 and Platinum 3. </li>
        <li>Emergency subs(those that you lose a ban for) can not exceed your starting players rank for that position. They can match it, but not exceed it.</li>
    </ol>
